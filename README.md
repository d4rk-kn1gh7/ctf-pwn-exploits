# ctf-pwn-exploits

A collection of exploits that I've written to solve pwn CTF challenges over the years (Yes, I've played a lot of CTFs). 

**Note:** Most of these exploits don't have writeups, a couple do. Check out my [blog](https://d4rk-kn1gh7.github.io/writeups/) for detailed writeups on a few challenges I've found particularly interesting.
