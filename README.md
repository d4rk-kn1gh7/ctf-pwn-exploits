# ctf-pwn-exploits

A collection of exploits that I've written to solve CTF challenges (primarily Binary Exploitation challenges) over the years (Yes, I've played a lot of CTFs). Each challenge folder contains the given attachments (binary, dependencies), along with the solution script that I used to solve it.

Most of these exploits don't have writeups, a couple do. Check out my [blog](https://d4rk-kn1gh7.github.io/writeups/) for detailed writeups on a few challenges I've found particularly interesting.

**Note:** These exploits are probably hacky/messy, as they were all written during the duration of the respective CTFs.
